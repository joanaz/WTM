# Manual install
You have found the manual installation instructions. If you'd prefer an easier way, please see our [Docker-based installation guide](markdown/install-and-use-docker.md). If you're sure you want to install manually, here's a list of libraries you'll need. Note: because this is a short workshop, the instructors may not have time to help you debug installation issues if they arrise. This approach is not supported. 

Here are the libraries you'll need:

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) On Mac OSX and Ubuntu, we recommend using a **virtualenv** based installation, as described on the installation page.

* [Magnta](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/image_stylization). Also download the pre-trained style transfer models (helpfully provided) on this page.

* [Fast Style Transfer](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer). Also download the pre-trained models.

* [Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
